A [relation](relation.md) $R$ on a set $A$ is said to be irreflexive or strict if  
$(x,x)$ does not belong to $R$ for any $x$ in $A$.  
That is, not $(xRx)$ for any $x$ in $A$.

*Note*: 

* Different elements can be related to each other in an irreflexive relation, but no element must be related to itself.
* It is possible for a [relation](relation.md) to be neither [reflexive](reflexive%20relation.md), nor [irreflexive](irreflexive%20relation.md).
