A [relation](relation.md) $\leq$ on a set $A$ is said to be a total order relation if it is  
[partial order](partial%20order%20relation.md) and [connected](connected%20relation.md).  
That is, the relation is [reflexive](reflexive%20relation.md), [antisymmetric](antisymmetric%20relation.md), [transitive](transitive%20relation.md), and [connected](connected%20relation.md).  
If $\leq$ is a total order on $A$, then the ordered pair $(A,\leq)$ is called as a [totally ordered set](totally%20ordered%20set.md) or a [TOSET](totally%20ordered%20set.md).

*Note*:

* A [TOSET](totally%20ordered%20set.md) is a [POSET](partially%20ordered%20set.md) where every pair of elements is comparable.
