A [relation](relation.md) $\leq$ on a set $A$ is said to be a partial order relation if it is  
[reflexive](reflexive%20relation.md), [antisymmetric](antisymmetric%20relation.md), and [transitive](transitive%20relation.md).  
If the set $A$ is equipped with a partial order $\leq$, then the ordered pair $(A,\leq)$ is called as a [partially ordered set](partially%20ordered%20set.md) or [POSET](partially%20ordered%20set.md).

*Note*:

* Two elements in a [POSET](partially%20ordered%20set.md) need not be related to each other, but when a pair of elements is related to each other, they are said to be comparable.
