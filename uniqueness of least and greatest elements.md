Let $(A,\leq)$ be a [partially ordered set](partially%20ordered%20set.md), let $l$ be a [least element](least%20and%20greatest%20elements.md).  
If $x$ happens to be another least element, that implies that $x\leq l$, but since $l$ is a least element, it implies that $l\leq x$.  
Since $\leq$ is [antisymmetric](antisymmetric%20relation.md) it implies that $x=l$, hence a least element of a partial ordered set, if it exists, is unique.

Similarly, it can be proven that the greatest element of a partially ordered set is also unique.
