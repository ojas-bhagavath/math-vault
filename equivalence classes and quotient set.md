If $R$ is an [equivalence relation](equivalence%20relation.md) on $A$, and if $x\in A$, then the set  
$cl(x):={y\in A: xRy}$  
is said to be the equivalence class of $x$.

The collection of all equivalence classes is called as the **quotient set** of $A$ by $R$, and is denoted by $A/R$.

*Note*:  
Due to the properties of equivalent relation, the following are true about equivalence classes:

1. All equivalence classes are non-empty.
1. Distinct equivalence classes are disjoint.
1. The union of all equivalence classes is $A$.
1. The above three properties imply that quotient sets are [partitions](partition%20of%20sets.md) of the set $A$.
