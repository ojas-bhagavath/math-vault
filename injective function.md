A [function](function.md) $f:A\to B$ is said to be an injection if  
$f(x)=f(y)$ implies that $x=y$ for any pair of $x$, $y$,  
that is, $x\neq y$ implies that $f(x)\neq f(y)$,  
or in other words, distinct elements in the domain have distinct elements in their range.

*Note*:

* If there exists an injection from $A$ to $B$, then [cardinal number](cardinal%20number.md) of $A$ is less than or equal to that of $B$.
* The cardinal number of $A$ is greater than that of $B$ if and only if there exists no injection from $A$ to $B$.
