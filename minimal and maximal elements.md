If $(A,\leq)$ is a [partially ordered set](partially%20ordered%20set.md), then 

* An element $m$ in $A$ is said to be minimal if there is no element $x\neq m$ in $A$ such that $x\leq m$.
* An element $M$ in $A$ is said to be maximal if there is no element $x\neq M$ in $A$ such that $M\leq x$.

*Note*:

* Existence: maximal/minimal elements need not exist in a [POSET](partially%20ordered%20set.md)/[TOSET](totally%20ordered%20set.md).
* Uniqueness: Since a pair of elements are not necessarily related in a [POSET](partially%20ordered%20set.md), it is possible that a set has more than one maximal/minimal element.
* Unlike [lower/upper bounds](lower%20and%20upper%20bounds%20of%20a%20subset.md), minimal/maximal elements has to belong to the set, and are defines on the whole [POSET](partially%20ordered%20set.md), and not just a subset.
* If $A$ is a [TOSET](totally%20ordered%20set.md), then minimal/maximal are the same as their [least/greatest](least%20and%20greatest%20elements.md) counterparts (if they exist).
