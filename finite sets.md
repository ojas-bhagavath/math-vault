A non-empty set is said to be finite if there exists no [injection](injective%20function.md) from $\mathbb{N}$ to the given set, or if there exists no [surjection](surjective%20function.md) from the given set to $\mathbb{N}$. Empty sets are also considered finite.  
In other words, if the cardinality of the set belongs to $\mathbb{N}$, then the set is said to be finite.
