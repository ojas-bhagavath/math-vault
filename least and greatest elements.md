If $(A,\leq)$ is a [partially ordered set](partially%20ordered%20set.md), then 

* An element $l$ in $A$ is said to be a least element if $l\leq x$ for every $x$ in $A$.
* An element $L$ in $A$ is said to be the greatest element if $x \leq L$ for every $x$ in $A$.

*Note*:

* Existence: least/greatest elements need not exist in a [POSET](partially%20ordered%20set.md)/[TOSET](totally%20ordered%20set.md).
* Uniqueness: If a least/greatest element exists in a [POSET](partially%20ordered%20set.md), it is [unique](uniqueness%20of%20least%20and%20greatest%20elements.md).
* If an element is least/greatest in a [POSET](partially%20ordered%20set.md), then it has to be minimal/maximal respectively.
* If $A$ is a [TOSET](totally%20ordered%20set.md), then least/greatest are the same as their [minimal/maximal](minimal%20and%20maximal%20elements.md) counterparts (if they exist).
