If $(A,\leq)$ is a [partially ordered set](partially%20ordered%20set.md), and if $S\subseteq A$ is a subset of $A$, then

* An element $b$ of $A$ is said to be a lower bound of $S$ if $b\leq x$ for each $x$ in $A$.
* An element $B$ in $A$ is said to be an upper bound of $S$ if $x\leq B$ for each $x$ in $A$.

*Note*:

* Existence: Lower and upper bounds of a subset $S$ need not exist.
* If lower bound of a subset exists, it is said to be [bounded below](bounded%20sets.md).
* If upper bound of a subset exists, it is said to be [bounded above](bounded%20sets.md).
* If both lower and upper bounds of a subset exist, it is said to be [bound](bounded%20sets.md).
* Uniqueness: Lower and upper bounds of a subset $S$ need not be unique.u
* Every finite subset of a [totally ordered set](totally%20ordered%20set.md) is [bounded](bounded%20sets.md).
* Empty set is vacuously bounded.
* Notice that lower and upper bounds of a set $S$ need not belong to the set $S$.
