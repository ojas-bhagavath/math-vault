A [relation](relation.md) is said to be antisymmetric if  
$(x,y)$ is in $R$, and $(y,x)$ are in $R$ only if $x=y$.  
That is, $xRy$ and $yRx$ implies $x=y$, or in other words,  
$x\neq y$ implies $xRy$ and $yRx$ cannot hold simultaneously.

It is possible that $x=y$, but $(x,y)$ is not in $R$, but if both $(x,y)$ and $(y,x)$ are in $R$, then **necessarily** $x=y$.

*Note*: 

* It is possible for a relation to be neither [symmetric](symmetric%20relation.md), nor [asymmetric](asymmetric%20relation.md), nor antisymmetric.
* An [identity relation](identity%20relation.md) is trivially an antisymmetric relation.
* An [empty relation](empty%20relation.md) is vacuously antisymmetric.
