If $(A,\leq)$ is a [partially ordered set](partially%20ordered%20set.md), and if $S\subseteq A$ is a subset, then

* $S$ is said to be **bounded below** if it has a [lower bound](lower%20and%20upper%20bounds%20of%20a%20subset.md) in $A$.
* $S$ is said to be **bounded above** if it has an [upper bound](lower%20and%20upper%20bounds%20of%20a%20subset.md) in $A$.
* $S$ is said to be **bounded** if it is both bounded above and bounded below.
