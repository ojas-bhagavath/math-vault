A [relation](relation.md) $\lt$ on a set $A$ is said to be a strict partial order if it is  
[asymmetric](asymmetric%20relation.md), and [transitive](transitive%20relation.md).

*Note*:

* Two distinct elements in $A$ need not be related under the relation $\lt$, but when a pair of elements are related, they are said to be comparable.
