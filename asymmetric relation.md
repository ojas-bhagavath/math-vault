A [relation](relation.md) is said to be asymmetric if  
whenever $(x,y)$ is in $R$, $(y,x)$ is **not** in $R$.  
That is, if $xRy$, then not $yRx$.

Alternatively, a relation is asymmetric if and only if it is both [antisymmetric](antisymmetric%20relation.md) and [irreflexive](irreflexive%20relation.md).

*Note*: 

* It is possible for a relation to be neither [symmetric](symmetric%20relation.md), nor asymmetric, nor [antisymmetric](antisymmetric%20relation.md).
* A [reflexive relation](reflexive%20relation.md) relation cannot be [asymmetric](asymmetric%20relation.md), and an [asymmetric relation](asymmetric%20relation.md) relation has to be [irreflexive](irreflexive%20relation.md).
