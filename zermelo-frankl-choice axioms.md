#### 1. [Axiom of extensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_extensionality):

Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements.

#### 2. [Axiom of regularity/foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_regularity):

Every non-empty set $A$ contains an element that is disjoint from $A$.

###### Implications:

* No set is an element of itself.
* For pair of sets, only one can be an element of the other.

#### 3. [Axiom schema of specification/of separation/ of restricted comprehension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema_of_specification):

Any condition one can pose on elements of a set defines a subset of the original set.

###### Implications:

* Empty sets are subsets of every set due to this axiom.

#### 4.  [Axiom of pairing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_pairing):

Given any two sets $A$ and $B$, there exists a set $C$ that has $A$ and $B$ as its elements.

#### 5. [Axiom of union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_union):

Given any collection of sets, the union over that collection always exists.

#### 6. [Axiom schema of replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema_of_replacement):

The image of a set under any definable mapping/function also forms a set.

#### 7. [Axiom of infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_infinity):

There exists a set with infinitely many distinct elements. More particularly, if $\omega$ is a set, and if $S(\omega)$ is defined as $\omega\cup{\omega}$, then there exists a set $I$ that contains $\varnothing$, and whenever a set $\omega$ belongs to the set $I$, the set $S(\omega)$ also belongs to $I$.  
This $I$ has infinitely many distinct elements.

#### 8. [Axiom of power set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_power_set):

Given any set $A$, there exists a set $P(A)$ that contains every subset of $A$.

#### 9. [Well ordering axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-ordering_theorem)/[Axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice):

Any non-empty set $X$ can be [well-ordered](well%20ordered%20set.md), meaning that given any non-empty set $X$, there exists a [binary relation](relation.md) $R$ on $X$ with respect to which $X$ is well-ordered.

Let $X$ be a set whose members are all nonempty. Then there exists a function $f$ from $X$ to the union of the members of $X$, called a "choice function", such that for all ${\displaystyle Y\in X}$ one has ${\displaystyle f(Y)\in Y}$.
