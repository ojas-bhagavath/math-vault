A [relation](relation.md) $R$ on a set $A$ is said to be symmetric if  
whenever $(x,y)$ belongs to $R$, $(y,x)$ also belongs to $R$.  
That is, if $xRy$, then $yRx$.

*Note*: 

* It is not necessary for a given $(x,y)$ to belong to $R$, but if it does, then $(y,x)$ must also belong to $R$ for $R$ to be symmetric.
