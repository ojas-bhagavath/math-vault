Since empty set is a subset of every set, it is also a subset of $A\times B$, hence it is a [relation](relation.md) from $A$ to $B$, also, since it is a subset of $A\times A$, it is a relation on $A$.  
No element of $A$ is related to any other element of $A$ under empty relation.

*Note*:

* The empty relation on a set $A$ is vacuously [symmetric](symmetric%20relation.md), [antisymmetric](antisymmetric%20relation.md), [irreflexive](irreflexive%20relation.md), [asymmetric](asymmetric%20relation.md), [transitive](transitive%20relation.md). However, it is not a [reflexive relation](reflexive%20relation.md).
