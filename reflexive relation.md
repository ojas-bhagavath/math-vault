A [relation](relation.md) $R$ on a set $A$ is said to be reflexive if  
$(x,x)$ belongs to $R$ for every $x$ in $A$.  
That is, $xRx$ for all $x$ in $A$.

*Note*: 

* Different elements can also be related to one another in a reflexive relation, but every element must be **necessarily** related to itself.
* It is possible for a [relation](relation.md) to be neither [reflexive](reflexive%20relation.md), nor [irreflexive](irreflexive%20relation.md).
* A [relation](relation.md)  cannot be both [reflexive](reflexive%20relation.md) and [irreflexive](irreflexive%20relation.md) simultaneously.
