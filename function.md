Let $A$ and $B$ be two non-empty sets. A [relation](relation.md) $R$ from set $A$ to a set $B$ is said to be a function if:

1. Every element in $A$ is related to some element in $B$, that is, every element in $A$ has an *image* in $B$.
1. Every element in $A$ is related to exactly one element in $B$, that is, every element in $A$ has a unique *image*.

*Note*:

* A function from $A$ to $B$ is usually denoted with $f:A\to B$, and image of any $x$ in $A$ is denoted as $f(x)$.
* If $f:A\to B$ is a function, then $A$ is said to be **domain** of the function $f$, and $B$ is said to be the **codomain** of $f$.
* If $f:A\to B$ is a function, the set $f(A):={f(x):x\in A}$ is said to be the **range** of $f$.
* **Restriction**: If $f:A\to B$ is a function, and if $C\subseteq A$ is a non-empty subset of $A$, then a restriction on $f$ by $C$ is defined as  
  $f|*{c}:C\to B,\quad f*{c}(x)=f(x)~~\\forall x\in C$.
