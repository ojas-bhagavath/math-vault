The identity [relation](relation.md) $R$ on a set $A$ is the following:  
$R = {(x,x):x\in A}$.  
That is, $xRx$ for all $x$ in $A$, and if $x\neq y$, then not $xRy$.

Different elements in the set must not be related to each other and every element must be related to itself. Such a relation is called as the identity relation.

*Note*: 

* The identity relation on a set is [reflexive](reflexive%20relation.md), [symmetric](symmetric%20relation.md), [transitive](transitive%20relation.md), [equivalence](equivalence%20relation.md), and [antisymmetric](antisymmetric%20relation.md).
