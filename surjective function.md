A [function](function.md) $f:A\to B$ is said to be surjective if  
for every element in $B$, there exists a preimage in $A$ under $f$,  
that is, $f(A)=B$, or range = co-domain.

*Note*:

* If there exists a surjection from $A$ to $B$, then the [cardinal number](cardinal%20number.md) of $A$ is greater than or equal to $B$.
* The cardinal number of $A$ is less than that of $B$ if and only if there exists no surjection from $A$ to $B$.
