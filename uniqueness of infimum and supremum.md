Let $(A,\leq)$ be a [partially ordered set](partially%20ordered%20set.md),and let $S\subseteq A$ be a subset of $A$.  
Let $t$ be an [infimum](infimum%20and%20supremum%20of%20a%20subset.md) of $S$, and let $x$ be another infimum of $S$.  
Since $x$ is a [lower bound](lower%20and%20upper%20bounds%20of%20a%20subset.md) and $l$ is an infimum, it implies that $x\leq l$.  
By symmetry of the argument, $l\leq x$.  
Since $\leq$ is [antisymmetric](antisymmetric%20relation.md), it implies that $l=x$  
This proves that infimum of a subset, when it exists, is unique.

By similar argument, supremum of a subset is also unique.
