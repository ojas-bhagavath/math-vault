If $(A,\leq)$ is a [partially ordered set](partially%20ordered%20set.md), and if $S\subseteq A$ is a subset of $A$, then:

* An element $t$ in $A$ is said to be a infimum of the set $S$ if
  * $t\leq x$ for each $x$ in $S$ ($t$ is a [lower bound](lower%20and%20upper%20bounds%20of%20a%20subset.md) of $S$).
  * If $y$ is any other lower bound of $S$, then $y\leq t$.
* An element $T$ in $A$ is said to be a supremum of the set $S$ if
  * $x\leq T$ for each $x$ in $S$ ($T$ is an [upper bound](lower%20and%20upper%20bounds%20of%20a%20subset.md)) of $S$).
  * If $y$ is any other upper bound of $S$, then $T\leq y$.

*Note*:

* Infimum and supremum are also referred to as **greatest lower bound** and **least upper bound** respectively.
* Infimum and supremum need not exist for a given subset.
* Infimum and supremum, when they exist, are [unique](uniqueness%20of%20infimum%20and%20supremum.md).
* Infimum and supremum of a subset need not belong to the subset.
