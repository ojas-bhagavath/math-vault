A [relation](relation.md) $\lt$ on a set $A$ is said to be a total order relation if it is  
[strict partial order](strict%20partial%20order%20relation.md) and [connected](connected%20relation.md).  
That is, the relation is [irreflexive](irreflexive%20relation.md), [antisymmetric](antisymmetric%20relation.md), [transitive](transitive%20relation.md), and [connected](connected%20relation.md).  
Or, the relation has to be [asymmetric](asymmetric%20relation.md), [transitive](transitive%20relation.md), and [connected](connected%20relation.md).

*Note*:

* If every pair of elements of $A$ are comparable under a [strict partial order relation](strict%20partial%20order%20relation.md) on $A$, that relation is said to be strict total order relation.
