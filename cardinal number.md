Cardinal number or cardinality is a generalization of the notion of "number  of elements in a set" when it comes to finite se ts.  
Cantor showed that even infinite need not have the same "number of elements"/"weight", so that lead to assignment of cardinal numbers to infinite sets as well.  
In essence, every set is assigned with a cardinal number.

For a set $A$, its cardinal number is denoted by $|A|$.

*Note*:

* There is a natural order to the cardinal numbers.
* A set is said to be finite if and only if its cardinal number belongs to $\mathbb{N}\cup{0}$.
* A set is said to be [countable/enumerable](countable%20sets.md) if and only if its cardinal number belongs to $\mathbb{N}\cup{0,\aleph\_{0}}$.
* A set is said countably infinite if and only if their cardinality is $\aleph\_{0}$.
* Two sets have the same cardinal number if and only if there exists a [bijection](bijective%20function.md) between them.
* A set $A$ has cardinal number greater than that of set $B$ if and only if there exists no [injection](injective%20function.md) from $A$ to $B$.
* A set $A$ has cardinal number less than or equal to that of set $B$ if and only if there exists an injection from $A$ to $B$.
* A set $A$ has cardinal number lesser than that of set $B$ if and only if there exists no [surjection](surjective%20function.md) from $A$ to $B$.
* A set $A$ has cardinal number greater than or equal to that of set $B$ if and only if there exists a surjection from $A$ to $B$.
