Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets, a (binary) relation $R$ from $A$ to $B$ is a subset of the Cartesian product $A\times B$.  
That is, $R\subseteq A\times B:={(x,y):x\in A, y\in B}$.

If $A$ is a set, then a relation from $A$ to itself is called as a "relation on $A$".

*Note*:

* Every subset of $A\times B$ defines a relation from $A$ to $B$, and every relation from $A$ to $B$ is a subset of $A\times B$.
* If $(x,y)\in R$, then we say that $x$ is related to $y$ under $R$, it is also denoted as $xRy$.
* If $(x,y)\in (A\times B)\backslash R$, then we say that $x$ is not related to $y$.
